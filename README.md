# Molecular Complexity Calculation 

This Mathematica function computes the molecular complexity given a SMILES string, InCHI, or molecule object as described in *An Additive Definition of Molecular Complexity* by Thomas Bottcher.

## Background
__Under Construction__

## Installation

Download the function source code from the repository, or use the Mathematica Function Repository notebook to deploy the function on your machine and view documentation and examples. (Future submission to the Wolfram Function Repository)

## Usage
Simply supply a molecular input in a supported format and you will get an output of complexity C<sub>m</sub>. 

## Support
Any support related inquiries may be directed to wborrelli@fordham.edu. 

## Authors and Acknowledgement
Dr. Joshua Schrier, Kim B. and Stephen E. Bepler Chair Professor of Chemistry at Fordham University, was immensely helpful in all aspects of this project.
