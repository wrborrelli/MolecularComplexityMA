# Molecular Complexity Calculation 

This Mathematica function computes the molecular complexity given a SMILES string, InCHI key, or molecule object as described in *An Additive Definition of Molecular Complexity* by Thomas Bottcher.

## Background
__Under Construction__

## Installation

Download the source code from the repository. (Future submission to the Wolfram Function Repository)

## Usage
Simply supply a molecular input in a supported format and you will get an output of complexity C<sub>m</sub>. Supported input formats include molecule object, SMILES string, InCHI. 

## Support
Any support related inquiries may be directed to wborrelli@fordham.edu. 

## Authors and Acknowledgement
Dr. Joshua Schrier, Kim B. and Stephen E. Bepler Chair Professor of Chemistry at Fordham University, was immensely helpful in all aspects of this project.
